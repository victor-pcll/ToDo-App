# ToDo App

A simple ToDo list app built with **Vue.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Electron**. This app allows users to create, manage, and track tasks in different to-do lists.

## Features

- Create and manage multiple to-do lists
- Add, edit, and delete tasks within each list
- Mark tasks as done or not done
- Save the user's tasks locally, so they persist even when the app is closed
- Cross-platform support for macOS, Windows, and Linux (with Electron)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Electron (for building desktop app)
- **State Management**: Vue's Composition API (with `ref` and `reactive`)
- **Build Tools**: Vite (for frontend development), Electron Builder (for packaging and distribution)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
